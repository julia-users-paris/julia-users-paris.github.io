          Welcome to the official page of Julia Paris Meetup!
          This meetup aims at promoting the <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a> programming language in Paris, France.
          <br>
          <br>
          All people welcome!

                <a href="https://github.com/ffevotte">Fran√ßois</a> will give a
                talk about "Accurate and Efficiently Vectorized Sums and Dot
                Products in Julia".
                <div class="summary">
                  This talk will present how basic algorithmic
                  blocks such as sums or dot products can be implemented in
                  Julia (and have been developed
                  in <a href="https://github.com/JuliaMath/AccurateArithmetic.jl"
                  style="font-family:monospace">AccurateArithmetic.jl</a>) in a
                  way that is both accurate and efficient. This example
                  illustrates how Julia can help efficiently mix
                  Floating-Point-related concerns with hardware, SIMD-related
                  constraints in order to get the performance of
                  double-precision state-of-the-art BLAS libraries and the
                  accuracy of quadruple-precision algorithms.
